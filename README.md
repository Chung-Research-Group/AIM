AIM
=========================

AIM is a collection of MATLAB based Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools for adsorption isotherm based fixed bed modelling. AIM modules provide an integrated workflow for adsorpion isoterm fitting, isosteric heat of adsorption estimation, mixture isotherm prediction, and multicomponent adsorption breakthrough simulation. AIM has been developed at Molecular Thermodynamics and Advanced Processes Lab [cmcp-group](https://sites.google.com/view/mtap-lab), Pusan National University.

Primary features of AIM include
- Integrated workflow within modules
- GUI environnment to facilitate data input/output, model selection, and simulation type selection
- Dynamic plots for pressure, loading, temperature, and composition
- Data and graphics export in different formats
