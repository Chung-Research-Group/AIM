AIM Installation
=========================
Use the AIM_Installer.exe file for installing AIM. 

AIM application requires **MATLAB Runtime** environment to run on machines which do not have MATLAB installed.
The AIM Installer will install both AIM application and MATLAB Runtime.

Please note that this file will only work for Windows users. Users of Linux and macOS need to compile AIM.
If you are Linux or macOS user, please follow the instruction given in the [READme](../build/READme.md) file located in the build directory for compilation.
